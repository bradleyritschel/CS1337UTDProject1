Don't just copy and paste this code for your project or I might get in trouble. If you copy and paste this code for a class at UT Dallas I will not be held liable for plagiarism, as I originally wrote and posted this code. This is meant to be a reference to future CS 1337 students, not a copy and paste cop-out.
